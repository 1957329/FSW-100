            <h3> The woodchuck (Marmota monax), belongs to the marmot family, and goes by many names,
                 including groundhog and whistle pig due to the sound they make through their large teeth to warn one another of danger.
                 While there are several species of marmots in North America, our woodchuck is found mostly in the eastern United States and across much of southern Canada.
                
                
                 In New England, woodchucks inhabit both urban and suburban yards, fields, meadows, woodland clearings, and we see them frequently in grassy areas along highways.
